No teaser singles. No cryptic tweets. Nothing.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>HOPE</strong> dropped April 2023</li>\n  <li>Tour wrapped in mid 2024</li>\n  <li>We‚Äôve heard nothing since</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We get that Nate likes to disappear between eras, but this one‚Äôs starting to feel like a full ghosting.
