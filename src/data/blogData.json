In early 2025, his team dropped a <em>deluxe version</em> of <strong>'The Party Never Ends'</strong> featuring 10 new tracks voted on by fans.</p>\n<p>📈 <strong>Chart Stats:</strong><br>– Back in UK Hip-Hop Albums Top 10<br>– No. 95 in UK Physical Albums</p>\n<h3>🎵 'Empty Out Your Pockets' – Juice WRLD (2024)</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Empty out your pockets, ain’t nothin’ left but hope /<br>\nChase the dreams I’ve always wrote...”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Classic Juice: Vulnerable bars, dreamy beat, and a hook that hits when you're broke but chasing greatness. Produced by <strong>Nick Mira</strong>, it's a standout from the deluxe edition.</p>\n\n<h2>🧠 NF: Still Fighting Demons, Still Winning</h2>\n<p><strong>NF</strong> released <strong>'HAPPY'</strong> as part of his 2023 album <em>HOPE</em>, and it’s still gaining traction today thanks to its gut-wrenching honesty about mental health and inner war.</p>\n<h3>🎶 'HAPPY' – NF (2023)</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Livin’ in my agony<br>\nWatchin' my self-esteem go up in flames...”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s NF doing what he does best — giving voice to those who never speak up. And yeah, it still gives chills.</p>\n\n<h2>🕹️ Bonus: Juice WRLD x Fortnite?</h2>\n<p>Rumors and leaks point to a <strong>Juice WRLD virtual collab in Fortnite</strong> — similar to Travis Scott and Ariana Grande events. His unreleased work with XXXTentacion might appear in-game too.</p>\n\n<h3>💭 Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Juice said it best: <em>“I still see your shadows in my room…”</em><br>\nBoth NF and Juice WRLD are leaving legacies that feel more alive than ever in 2025.</p>",

  "content": "<h2>🧠 When Lyrics Hit Too Real: 'HAPPY' by NF</h2>\n<p>Three years later, <strong>'HAPPY'</strong> still sounds like a letter we never sent. And in 2025, with no new album after the <em>HOPE World Tour</em>, it hits harder than ever.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Living in my agony<br>\nWatching my self-esteem go up in flames<br>\nActing like I don’t care what anyone else thinks...”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This song wasn’t just a track. It was therapy. NF dug deep into vulnerability, depression, and the contradiction of wanting to feel better but not knowing who you’d be if you actually were.</p>\n\n<h2>⏳ The Wait: Tour’s Over, Now What?</h2>\n<p><strong>NF’s HOPE World Tour</strong> ran heavy in 2023–2024. Fans got to hear <em>HAPPY</em> live, feel the weight of <em>MOTTO</em>, and vibe to <em>Let You Down</em> in packed arenas.</p>\n<p>But now it’s 2025... and silence. <strong>No new album</strong>. No teaser singles. No cryptic tweets. Nothing.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>HOPE</strong> dropped April 2023</li>\n  <li>Tour wrapped in mid 2024</li>\n  <li>We’ve heard nothing since</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We get that Nate likes to disappear between eras, but this one’s starting to feel like a full ghosting. Fans want more than just HOPE on repeat.</p>\n\n<h3>🎶 'HAPPY' - Full Lyric Snapshot</h3>\n<p><em>Verse 1:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Dear God, please hear me out, I know it’s been a couple years<br>\nSince I’ve reached out and said hello...<br>\nI know I’ve been selfish, I have no excuse to give You, it’s true”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Chorus:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Living in my agony<br>\nWatching my self-esteem go up in flames...”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Verse 2:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Yeah, been this way so long, it feels like something’s off when I’m not depressed<br>\nI got some issues that I won’t address...”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>🔁 Still On Repeat</h2>\n<p>People still use <strong>'HAPPY'</strong> in TikToks, short films, mental health threads — because even though NF’s quiet, his message isn’t.</p>\n\n<h3>🗓️ What's Next?</h3>\n<p>Rumors say a new NF project might hit late 2025 or early 2026. But honestly? We’ve been burned before. All we want is some kind of update. Even a freestyle. A beat drop. A sigh into the mic, bro. Something.</p>\n\n<h3>💭 Final Words</h3>\n<p>If you’re tired of waiting — same. But maybe that’s the point.<br>\nNF once said, “<em>I got some baggage I ain’t opened yet</em>.” Maybe we’re all still unpacking too.</p>",
